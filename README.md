# SLU - Self Learners Unite
![SLU Logo](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1QfxmLHdaMQbTwewC1SVA0YlCrD1vlJb5)

Here at SLU we want to make self-learning a breeze! We want you to feel 
part of a community whose goal is to learn together

This project is aimed at bringing a super beginner friendly 
Open Source project to beginners. 

The SLU website is a complete mess and we need you the community to come
help build it up.

We want this to be a project that people feel comfortable contributing to,
which is why our own [@SanoviaM](https://github.com/SanoviaM) helped build the Contribution Guide to what it is!

So please feel free to fork and submit as many pull requests as you want to help build the community. We want resources, code, books, scripts, whatever
we can use to help people learn for themselves!

Big Shoutout to [@SapphireLabel](https://github.com/SapphireLabel) for the wonderful graphics and to [@koleahmantle](https://github.com/koleahmantle) for keeping us organized! We also got [@CoDeKiNeSiS](https://github.com/CoDeKiNeSiS) who silently supports us 
and makes sure we are doing ok! Without them I would never feel confident to
do something like this on my own! So big thanks to them!!
